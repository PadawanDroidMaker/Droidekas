        <p class = "aboutp">Droidekas is a club organized by Qatar University students. The main focus of the club is 
        robotics and automation. The name, Droidekas, is derived from one of the robot types that appeared 
        in the Star Wars franchise. In Droidekas, we aim at providing our members with premium knowledge
        about robotics, and to one day launch a startup that will act as one of the main suppliers of 
        robotic devices to big companies and organizations including companies in the space industry.
